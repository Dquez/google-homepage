In this project, I will be replicating the google homepage. Maybe after I'm done, I'll add some personal flair to it to showcase my newly learned html and css skills.
A link to the course project can be found here from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)
There were a couple of instances where I had to use outside sources for help on concepts I haven't learned thoroughly such as box-shadowing but with the help of google, Stack Overflow and other online resources, I was able to closely resemble Google's homepage.
